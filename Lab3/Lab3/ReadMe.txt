Gillian Laming, Lab 3

Errors encountered over the course of the lab:
- no errors, but I did have signed/unsigned incompatibility errors that I encountered. I fixed this by making an int an unsigned int.

Test Cases ran:
1. Badly formatted input string
return: usage message
2. too many arguments
- usage message 
3. proper input -- started the game
user can input quit at any point to quit the game

Notes:
- the boarder pieces of the game board have color "boarder". this is how i distinugished them
over the course of the lab
- player == true corresponds to 'X'
- player == false corresponds to 'O'
