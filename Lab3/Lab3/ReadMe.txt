Gillian Laming, Lab 3

Errors encountered over the course of the lab:
- no errors, but I did have signed/unsigned incompatibility errors that I encountered. I fixed this by making an int an unsigned int.

Notes:
- the boarder pieces of the game board have color "boarder". this is how i distinugished them
over the course of the lab
- player == true corresponds to 'X'
- player == false corresponds to 'O'
