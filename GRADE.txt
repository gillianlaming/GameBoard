-3: Compilation warnings
Examples of compilation warnings you got:
1>h:\cse332grading\grading-ptkpyitheim\lab3\lab3-gdlaming\lab3\lab3\tictactoe.cpp(18): warning C4267: 'initializing': conversion from 'size_t' to 'int', possible loss of data
1>h:\cse332grading\grading-ptkpyitheim\lab3\lab3-gdlaming\lab3\lab3\tictactoe.cpp(33): warning C4267: 'initializing': conversion from 'size_t' to 'int', possible loss of data
1>h:\cse332grading\grading-ptkpyitheim\lab3\lab3-gdlaming\lab3\lab3\tictactoe.cpp(126): warning C4267: 'initializing': conversion from 'size_t' to 'int', possible loss of data

-3 : Not giving me correct usage function if I run this sequence below:

2,2 (turn 1)
3,2 (turn 2)
2,2 (turn 3) - A player placed a piece in this coordinate already but no usage message for that was given. Your program just reprompts.


-3 : Wrong way of printing board although explicitly stated in the lab instructions
Correct way:
4
3
2
1
0
 0 1 2 3 4

Your board:
4
3
2
1
0 1234

-2 : ReadMe Test Case documenting
When you said "Badly Formatted Input String", you need to also give examples of them.
Document exactly your badly fomatted input string and write down how your program responds.
Same applies for other cases (i.e. too many arguments and proper input -- started the game).

-1 : Hard coding in TicTacToeGame:: done() method
